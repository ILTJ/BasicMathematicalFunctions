BasicMathematicalFunctions
==========================

A programme to calculate the mathematical qualities of numbers in a file. For an extension of this program, please look at File-I-O--Basic-Math-Functions-2-Mac (https://github.com/snivysteel/File-I-O--Basic-Math-Functions-2-Mac). Credits to Liew Zhao Wei (https://github.com/zwliew) and Ryan Wong (https://github.com/snivysteel) for advising me.

For this program to work, one must create a document called 'data.txt'. The integers inputed into the document must be within 1 to 100. While those creating the document can and should create their own set of integers, those that do not want to can use the integers inputed in the 'data.txt' document in this repository, which are '3 5 2 6 4 1'.

Subsequently, after running the program with the document 'data.txt' filled up as per the above instructions, another document, 'output.txt', will be automatically created. I have also uploaded to this repository the 'output.txt' document that I obtained when I ran the program. As you can see, the results produced in 'output.txt' are accurate, which proves that this program works fine.

This program is written in C++. I plan to upload variations of this program in other programming langauges soon. Please give me suggestions on which programming langauages to convert this program to. If able to, please provide me with programming translator options that are accurate or fork this program and provide an alternative programming language.
